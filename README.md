# TFGNer
Code for End Grade Project

This code is only for testing that the functions newInfo and makeRelations work as intended and can be incorporated in our NER model.
Here will also be included a test.py section which is just random code for testing other implementations and a data.json which will 
be used for testing.

To run the code just use the command in the terminal:

python3 relation_extractionV1.py

To run TestPyUnit.py use command:

python3 TestPyUnit.py
